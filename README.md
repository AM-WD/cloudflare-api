# Cloudflare API for .NET

This project aims to implement the [Cloudflare API] in an extensible way.

## Overview

There should be a package for each API section as defined by Cloudflare.


### [Cloudflare]

This is the base client, that will perform the request itself. It has the base url and holds the credentials.


### [Cloudflare.Zones]

If you install this package, you will get all methods to handle a DNS zone.
